# Payment Integration Processor
This module provides an application based on [commercetools Connect](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect), which is triggered by HTTP requests from Checkout UI for payment operations.

The corresponding payment, cart or order details would be fetched from composable commerce platform, and then be sent to external PSPs for various payment operations such as create/capture/cancel/refund payment.

The module also provides template scripts for post-deployment and pre-undeployment action. After deployment or before undeployment via connect service completed, customized actions can be performed based on users' needs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Please run following npm commands under `processor` folder.

#### Install PSP SDK
In case SDK is provided by payment service provider for communication purpose, you can import the SDK by following commands
```
$ npm install <psp-sdk>
```
#### Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
#### Build the application in local environment. NodeJS source codes are then generated under dist folder
```
$ npm run build
```
#### Run automation test
```
$ npm run test
```
#### Run the application in local environment. Remind that the application has been built before it runs
```
$ npm run start
```
#### Fix the code style
```
$ npm run lint:fix
```
#### Verify the code style
```
$ npm run lint
```
#### Run post-deploy script in local environment
```
$ npm run connector:post-deploy
```
#### Run pre-undeploy script in local environment
```
$ npm run connector:pre-undeploy
```

## Running application

Setup correct environment variables: check `processor/src/config/config.ts` for default values.

Make sure commercetools client credential have at least the following permissions:

* `manage_payments`
* `manage_orders`
* `manage_checkout_payment_intents`
* `view_sessions`
* `introspect_oauth_tokens`

```
npm run dev
```

## Authentication

Some of the services have authentication mechanism. 

* `oauth2`: Relies on commercetools OAuth2 server
* `session`: Relies on commercetools session service
* `jwt`: Relies on the jwt token injected by the merchant center via the forward-to proxy

### OAuth2
OAuth2 token can be obtained from commercetools OAuth2 server. It requires API Client created beforehand. For details, please refer to [Requesting an access token using the Composable Commerce OAuth 2.0 service](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/authorization#requesting-an-access-token-using-the-composable-commerce-oauth-20-service).

### Session
Payment connectors relies on session to be able to share information between `enabler` and `processor`.
To create session before sharing information between these two modules, please execute following request to commercetools session service
```
POST https://session.<region>.commercetools.com/<commercetools-project-key>/sessions
Authorization: Bearer <oauth token with manage_sessions scope>

{
  "cart": {
    "cartRef": {
      "id": "<cart-id>" 
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "allowedPaymentMethods": ["card", "ideal", ...],
    "paymentInterface"?: "<payment interface that will be set on payment method info https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/payments#ctp:api:type:PaymentMethodInfo>"
  }
}
```

Afterwards, session ID can be obtained from response, which is necessary to be put as `x-session-id` inside request header when sending request to endpoints such as `/operations/config` and `/operations/payments`.

### JSON web token (JWT)

`jwt` needs some workaround to be able to test locally as it depends on the merchant center forward-to proxy.

In order to make easy running the application locally, following commands help to build up a jwt mock server:

####Set environment variable to point to the jwksUrl
```
export CTP_JWKS_URL="http://localhost:9002/jwt/.well-known/jwks.json"
```
####Run the jwt server
```
docker compose up -d
```

####Obtain JWT
```
# Request token
curl --location 'http://localhost:9002/jwt/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "iss": "https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com",
    "sub": "subject",
    "https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com/claims/project_key": "<commercetools-project-key>"
}'
```
Token can be found in response
```
{"token":"<token>"}
```

Use the token to authenticate requests protected by JWT: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. 

## APIs

The processor exposes following endpoints to execute various operations with Braintree platform:

### Create payment session

It creates payment resource in composable commerce and create Braintree payment session in payment service provider.

#### Endpoint

`POST /init`

#### Request Parameters

The endpoint accepts empty request body.

#### Response Parameters

- clientToken: [A token is generated](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/start/hello-server/ruby/#generate-a-client-token]) and it contains all authorization and configuration information your client needs to initialize the client SDK to communicate with Braintree.
- paymentReference : It represents the unique identifier of payment resource created in composable commerce platform.

### Create payment

It mainly starts an Braintree payment transaction in payment services provider. If payment reference is absent in request parameters, the endpoint creates payment resource in composable commerce based on data from the cart.

#### Endpoint

`POST /payments`

#### Request Parameters

The request body contains following attributes

- nonce: It represents one-time-use token reference to payment information from customer.
- paymentReference: It represents the unique identifier of payment resource created in composable commerce platform.

#### Response Parameters

The response body contains following attributes
- id: Identifier of Braintree transaction.
- success: The successity of create transaction in Braintree platform.
- message: Optional. It represents the message returned from Braintree response.
- paymentReference: The unique identifier of the commercetools payment created.
- additionalProcessorResponse: Optional. It represents the raw response of Braintree processor.
- amount: The transaction amount created.
- status: The status of the Braintree transaction.

### Get supported payment components

Private endpoint protected by JSON Web Token that exposes the payment methods supported by the connector so that checkout application can retrieve the available payment components.
